## 🚀 Who is this for?

This tutorial assumes you already have *basic Python knowledge*, including:

- Using numpy and pandas for data handling  
- Knowing what a .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file is  
- Using scikit-learn to build simple machine learning models

> *Don't know Python yet?* No problem!  
> Start with the resources below before continuing:
>
> -  [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)  
> -  [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)  
> -  [Python for Beginners (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KVEU3aaeQ&t=56s)
